1. **Insertion**
   - Insert at the beginning: Add a new node to the beginning of the linked list.
   - Insert at the end: Add a new node to the end of the linked list.
   - Insert at a specific position: Add a new node after a specific node or at a given index.

2. **Deletion**
   - Delete from the beginning: Remove the first node in the linked list.
   - Delete from the end: Remove the last node in the linked list.
   - Delete a specific element: Remove a node with a specific value or at a given position.
   - Delete by reference: Remove a specific node if you have a reference to it.

3. **Searching**
   - Search by value: Find a node with a specific value in the linked list.
   - Search by position: Find a node at a specific index.

4. **Traversal**
   - Print the linked list: Traverse the linked list from the beginning to the end and print each node's value.
   - Reverse traversal: Traverse the linked list in reverse order (if it's a doubly linked list).

5. **Length Count**
   - Calculate the number of nodes in the linked list.

6. **Merge and Concatenation**
   - Merge two linked lists into a single linked list.
   - Concatenate multiple linked lists together.

7. **Splitting**
   - Split a linked list into two linked lists at a specific node.

8. **Detecting Loops**
   - Determine if a loop exists in the linked list using techniques like Floyd's cycle detection algorithm.

9. **Reversal**
   - Reverse the order of nodes in the linked list.

10. **Intersection and Union**
    - Find the intersection of two linked lists (common elements).
    - Find the union of two linked lists (all unique elements).

11. **Copy and Clone**
    - Create a copy or clone of the linked list.

12. **Sorting**
    - Sort the linked list using various sorting algorithms.

13. **Circular Linked List Operations**
    - Find the starting point of a loop in a circular linked list.
    - Convert a circular linked list to a regular linked list.

14. **Doubly Linked List Operations**
    - Insertion and deletion in doubly linked lists.
    - Reverse traversal in doubly linked lists.

15. **Memory Management**
    - Properly allocate and deallocate memory for nodes to prevent memory leaks.

16. **Error Handling**
    - Handle potential errors, such as trying to delete a node that doesn't exist or accessing an empty linked list.

These operations are fundamental to working with linked lists in various data structure and algorithm scenarios.
