Arrays in C++ support various operations that allow you to manipulate and work with the data they contain. Here's a list of common operations that can be performed on arrays:

Accessing Elements: You can access individual elements of an array using their indices, which start at 0.

Modifying Elements: You can change the value of an array element by assigning a new value to it.

Finding Length: Determine the number of elements in an array, usually using the sizeof operator or by keeping track of the array's size.

Looping Through Elements: Use loops (e.g., for, while, or foreach) to iterate through the elements of an array.

Searching: Find a specific element in an array by comparing each element with the target value. Common search algorithms include linear search and binary search for sorted arrays.

Sorting: Sort the elements of an array in ascending or descending order. Common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and quicksort.

Adding Elements: While C++ arrays have a fixed size, you can create a new, larger array and copy elements from the original array to effectively "add" elements.

Deleting Elements: Similarly, you can create a new array without the elements you want to delete and copy the remaining elements.

Finding Minimum and Maximum: Iterate through the array to find the minimum and maximum elements.

Checking for Equality: Compare two arrays to check if they are equal.

Merging Arrays: Combine the elements of two arrays into a new array.

Reversing an Array: Reverse the order of elements in an array.

Shifting or Rotating: Shift or rotate the elements in the array to the left or right.

Copying Arrays: Copy the elements from one array to another.

Filling an Array: Set all elements of an array to a specific value.

Sum and Average: Calculate the sum and average of elements in an array.

Checking for Empty or Full Arrays: Determine if an array is empty or full based on its size and the number of elements.

Filtering: Create a new array containing elements that meet a certain condition.

Mapping: Apply a function or operation to each element of an array, creating a new array with the results.

Multidimensional Arrays: Perform all the above operations on multidimensional arrays, including 2D arrays (matrices) and higher-dimensional arrays.

Dynamic Arrays: In C++, you can use containers like std::vector to work with dynamically resizable arrays, which allow for easy addition and removal of elements.
